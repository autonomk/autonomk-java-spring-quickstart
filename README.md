Autonomk makes it fast and easy to build your private AI platform. You control all elements of your data and tech, we help you build it.

* **Client-Server Architecture:** The autonomk web app is a single page application, built with open source technologies, which is decoupled from the server. This allows you to build your server as you want and control your deployment.
* **Reduce development costs:** Save time and money and do not reinvent the wheel. Autonomk provides you with the blueprint to help you develop your AI application quickly and connect to the autonomk frontend.
* **Language agnostic:** Autonomk does not force you to use any particular language and is easily integrated into any tech stack, whether legacy or greenfield. This flexibility gives you everything you need to build a private AI platform.


## Introduction
This quickstart guide is intended for **demonstration purposes only** and should be adapted for production. All data is stored in the application memory, and will be cleared when the server is restarted.

This repo acts as both the web server from which you will deploy the Autonomk AI client, and also the REST API which the AI client communicates with.

In a production system the AI client may be deployed from a CDN or a webserver which is not coupled with the API server.

### Spring Boot

#### run
To **run** the Spring Boot app run the following command
```bash 
./mvnw spring-boot:run
``` 
in the terminal.

#### port
To change the port the Spring Boot app runs on, update the **application.properties** file in the resources folder by adding the following line `server.port=8091`
#### ollama
After you have installed and have ollama running in your terminal, update the `spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.model=llama3.2`, replace the llama3.2 with the model you want to use (this is the model you would have pulled using Ollama).

### Autonomk AI Client
Download the Autonomk AI client from the [Autonomk website](https://autonomk.com/). 

* The username and password have been hardcoded to the following credentials

| credentials  | values  |
| --- | --- |
|username | user
|password | password

* You can change the port the AI client points to in the env.js file by updating the `HOST` field.

## Installation
Clone this repo and have the following installed as a minimum:
1. Java 21
2. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
3. Copy the contents of the Autonomk AI client to `/resources/static` folder

## Development
### Styling
* To style the Autonomk AI client, use [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/), click on **Start Customizing**, once you have picked your colours click on **code** in the top right-hand corner. This opens a dialog containing the CSS code, which looks something like this
```css
:root {
  --background: oklch(0.9777 0.0041 301.4256);
  --foreground: oklch(0.3651 0.0325 287.0807);
  --card: oklch(1.0000 0 0);
  --card-foreground: oklch(0.3651 0.0325 287.0807);
  ...
```
In the folder `public/styles/theme.css` of the Autonomk AI client replace the contents of the file with your styles generated by tweakcn.

### Environment Variables
The `public/scripts/env.js` file in the Autonomk AI client contains environment variables which configure the client.

| **Variable** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
|HOST | The restful api endpoint the AI client communicates with
|TITLE | The title of the AI client, used on the login pages and in the html document
|DEFAULT_THEME| The default theme, either light or dark

### .gitignore
In this repo the **resources/static** folder is ignored by git. Remove this line if you want to push the Autonomk AI client files to git.

### Web Server
The web server is defined in the **SpaController.java** file, this serves the AI client.

## Notes

* **CORS** Has been enabled in the Spring Boot server. This is to allow demonstrating the features of Autonomk. CORS, along with other HTTP security measures should be disabled in production.
